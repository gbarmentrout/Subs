00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
I am not throwing away my shot!

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
I am not throwing away my shot!

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
Hey yo, I’m just like my country

4
00:00:07 --> 00:09:
I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot!

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
I’m ‘a get a scholarship to King’s College

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
I gotta holler just to be heard With every word, I drop knowledge!

9
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Tryin’ to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Only nineteen but my mind is older

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder

13
00:00:33 --> 00:34:
Ev’ry burden, ev’ry disadvantage I have learned to manage, 

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
I don’t have a gun to brandish I walk these streets famished

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
But damn, it’s getting dark, so let me spell out the name, I am the—

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
A-L-E-X-A-N-D

18
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
E-R—we are—meant to be…

19
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
A colony that runs independently

20
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin’ on us endlessly

21
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly

22
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
He ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free

24
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
So there will be a revolution in this century

25
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Enter me! (He says in parentheses)

26
00:01:07 --> 00:00:08
Don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book mentions me

27
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
I will lay down my life if it sets us free

28
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
Eventually, you’ll see my ascendancy

29
00:01:15 --> 00:00:16
And I am not throwing away my shot

30
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
I am not throwing away my shot

31
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
Hey yo, I’m just like my country I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot

32
00:01:25 --> 00:01:26
I am not throwing away my shot

33
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
I am not throwing away my shot

34
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
Hey yo, I’m just like my country I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot

35
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
It’s time to take a shot!

36
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
I dream of life without a monarchy

37
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
The unrest in France will lead to ‘onarchy?

38
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
‘Onarchy? How you say, how you say, oh ‘anarchy?’

39
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
When I fight, I make the other side panicky with my—Shot!

40
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Yo, I’m a tailor’s apprentice

41
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
And I got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis

42
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
I’m joining the rebellion cuz I know it’s my chance to socially advance, instead of sewin’ some pants!

43
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
I’m gonna take a—Shot!

44
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
But we’ll never be truly free until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me

45
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in on a stallion with the first black battalion

46
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
Have another—Shot!

47
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
Geniuses, lower your voices you keep out of trouble and you double your choices

48
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught

49
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
You’ve got to be carefully taught:If you talk, you’re gonna get-Shot!

50
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
Burr, check what we got, Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot

51
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
I think your pants look hot Laurens, I like you a lot

52
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
Let’s hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin’ the pot...

53
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot

54
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
Poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not

55
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists? Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

56
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
Oh, am I talkin’ too loud?

57
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth

58
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
I never had a group of friends before I promise that I’ll make y’all proud

59
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
Let’s get this guy in front of a crowd

60
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
I am not throwing away my shot

61
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55	
I am not throwing away my shot

62
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
Hey yo, I’m just like my country I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot

63
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
I am not throwing away my shot

64
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
I am not throwing away my shot

65
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
Hey yo, I’m just like my country I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot

66
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
Ev’rybody sing: Whoa, whoa, whoa

67
00:03:16 --> 00:03:17
Hey!

68
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
Whoa!Wooh!!Whoa!

69
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
Ay, let ‘em hear ya!

70
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
Let’s go!

71
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
I said shout it to the rooftops!

72
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
Said, to the rooftops!

73
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
Come on!

74
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
Come on, let’s go!

75
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!Yea!

76
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!Yea!

77
00:03:34 --> 00:03:34
Rise up!

78
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
When you’re living on your knees, you rise up

79
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
Tell your brother that he’s gotta rise up

80
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

81
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

82
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

83
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

84
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

85
00:03:51 --> 00:03:51
Rise up!

86
00:03:52 --> 00:03:52
Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!Whoa!

87
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
Rise up!

88
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory

89
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
When’s it gonna get me? In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?

90
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
If I see it comin’, do I run or do I let it be?

91
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
Is it like a beat without a melody?

92
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
See, I never thought I’d live past twenty

93
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Where I come from some get half as many

94
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask we have to make this moment last, that’s plenty

95
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
Scratch that, This is not a moment, it’s the movement

96
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?

97
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand

98
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land

99
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
And? If we win our independence? Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?

100
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless ycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?

101
00:04:37 --> 00:04:42
I know the action in the street is excitin’, but Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’ I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’

102
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
We need to handle our financial situation Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of our nation?


103
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
I’m past patiently waitin’.

104
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
I’m passionately smashin’ every expectation Every action’s an act of creation!

105
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow, for the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow

106
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
And I am not throwing away my shot

107
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
I am not throwing away my shot

108
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
Hey yo, I’m just like my country I’m young, scrappy and hungry And I’m not throwing away my shot

109
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
We’re gonna rise up! (Time to take a shot!)

110
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
We’re gonna rise up! (Time to take a shot!)

111
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
We’re gonna

112
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
Time to take a shot! (rise up! rise up!) Time to take a shot!

113
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
(rise up!) Time to take a shot!Take a shot!Shot!Shot!


114
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
A-yo it’s-Time to take a shot!Time to take a shot!

115
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
And I am—Not throwing away my-

116
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
Not throwing away my shot
